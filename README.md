# Hello world! 🌍

_Impact is a word tossed around a lot, but what if you could actually change people's lives for the better, legitimately, with no BS attached?_

## About Me
I’m **Amgad**, passionate about building AI agents designed to make society more equitable, give people more freedom, access and success.
At 16, I was flipping cars in Dubai, eventually scaling to luxury imports. Teachers thought I wouldn’t make it — I skipped homework until 11th grade, but I went on to study CS at TUM, do graduate research at UC Berkeley, and become a top-performing intern at Amazon, recognized across Europe for my “inventing and simplifying.” (whatever that means, but I guess I did alright).
