# Hello 🌍! 

_Today, we're at a point where man and software are inseperable. Love or hate innovation, to me, that makes technology the gateway to having real impact in people's lives._

## About Me
I’m **Amgad**,  a CS graduate student at TUM and UC Berkeley, building software that makes complex things more accessible, especially in products that help people learn, work, and move faster.

At 7 I traded card collectibles at school and learned my first lesson about getting scammed; at 10 I went door-to-door selling toys to neighbors; at 12 I was known for buying new sneakers by selling candy out of my schoolbag with my brother. At 16, I was flipping cars in Dubai and eventually scaled to luxury imports.
Teachers underestimated me early on, honestly, I gave them reasons to. I didn’t take school seriously until the final years because I only worried about personal projects I cared about. I learned the hard way that talent without discipline doesn’t scale and I flipped learning into a system I could improve. It lead me to study CS at TUM, graduate research at UC Berkeley, and nomination for my time at Amazon. 

I always had curiosity about the world, and obsession maximizing my life and its opportunities in every metric, a 'why not' mentality, and all that naturally lead me to technology, the bridge to all things and every corner of this world. 

A life worth living needs the good and the bad parts, and one on your own terms, otherwise the story’s boring.
