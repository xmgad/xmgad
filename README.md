# Hello 🌍! 

_I’m building a life with stakes. Software is my lever, because it turns bold ideas into systems that scale._

## About Me
I’m **Amgad**,  a CS graduate student at TUM and UC Berkeley, building software that makes complex things more accessible, especially in products that help people learn, work, and move faster.

I've been hustling since I was a kid: trading cards at 7, selling door-to-door at 10, running a schoolbag candy ops at 12. By 16, I was flipping cars in Dubai and scaling to luxury imports from Oman. Teachers underestimated me early on, and I gave them reasons to. I didn't take school seriously until I realized talent without discipline is wasted potential. Once I treated learning like a system to optimize, everything changed. That led to CS and research at TUM & UC Berkeley, and Amazon, where I was recognized as one of Europe's top grad students for simplifying complex problems.

My research at Berkeley and TUM spanned from spatial computing to how algorithmic objectives, optimizing for engagement versus credibility, shape public perception of political news. Research is a powerful way to explore curiosity, but it lacks the speed of real-world application. That tension pushed me away from a PhD path and toward building.

My philosophy is simple: No one gets to write my story but me. I want to maximize impact and upside. I want to build ambitious products, live intensely, be known for my craft and use the leverage to create real opportunity for people who start with less.

If you're building something interesting or just want to chat, feel free to reach out.
