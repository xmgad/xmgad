## About Me
I’m **Amgad**,  a CS graduate student at TUM and UC Berkeley, building software that makes complex things more accessible, especially in products that help people learn, work, and move faster.

At 7 I traded card collectibles at school and learned my first lesson about getting scammed; at 10 I went door-to-door selling toys to neighbors; at 12 I was known for buying new sneakers by selling candy out of my schoolbag with my brother. At 16, I was flipping cars in Dubai and eventually scaled to luxury imports. Somewhere along the way, I realized software is the highest-leverage way to turn scrappy ideas into systems that scale. Teachers understimated me, tbf I didn’t take school seriously early on and never did what I was told, I skipped homework until 11th grade, but I eventually locked in, went on to study CS at TUM, graduate research at UC Berkeley, and become a top-performing intern at Amazon, recognized across Europe for “inventing and simplifying.” (whatever that means, but I guess I did alright) 

A life worth living needs the good and the bad parts, and one on your own terms, otherwise the story’s boring.
